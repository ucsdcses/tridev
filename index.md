TriDev is a quarter-long program that allows students to build end-to-end CS projects.

Students are set into groups of 4 to 5 people, and build software projects throughout the quarter. Students get to build skills that recruiters look for, and can build a project that they can feature on their resumes!


***`Before reading further, TriDev is time intensive. Be ready to put in 7-10 hours per week if you apply.`***
